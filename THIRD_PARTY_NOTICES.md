# Third-Party Notices

Original imgstamp code, documentation, and project-generated fixtures are
licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Third-party software and artwork
retain their original licenses; the root MIT license does not replace them.

Include both `LICENSE` and this complete `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` with binary
releases. Source distributions must also retain the fixture attribution and
license in `internal/pages/testdata/`. Update this inventory when dependencies,
the Go toolchain, or third-party assets change.

## Go modules

The versions below match `go.mod`. The application dependency lists for
macOS ARM64 and Windows x64 were inspected; `golang.org/x/sys` is used in the
Windows build. Test-only tooling dependencies of upstream modules are not
presented as application dependencies.

| [golang.org/x/sys](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sys@v0.48.0) | v0.48.0 | BSD-3-Clause | Indirect Windows system support |

The Go runtime and standard library used to build the application are also
covered by the Go BSD-3-Clause license reproduced below (inspected with Go
1.27.1). The Go Regular test font is provided by `golang.org/x/image/font/gofont/goregular`;
it is used in tests and is not embedded in the application executable.

### Additional Go patent grant

The identical `PATENTS` notice shipped with Go and those three golang.org/x
modules is retained below:

```text
Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)

"This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by
Google as part of the Go project.

Google hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
transfer and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of this
implementation of Go, where such license applies only to those patent
claims, both currently owned or controlled by Google and acquired in
the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily infringed by this
implementation of Go.  This grant does not include claims that would be
infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this
implementation.  If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or
order or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that this implementation of Go or any code incorporated within this
implementation of Go constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then any patent
rights granted to you under this License for this implementation of Go
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
```

## Go Regular font used in tests

Tests load the Go Regular font from `golang.org/x/image/font/gofont/goregular`.
The font has its own Bigelow & Holmes copyright notice. The following license
text is reproduced from the font's embedded OpenType name-table license record
(name ID 13). It is not a bundled application font.

```text
Copyright (c) 2016 Bigelow & Holmes Inc.. All rights reserved.

Distribution of this font is governed by the following license. If you do not agree to this license, including the disclaimer, do not distribute or modify this font.

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

   * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

   * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

## Go gopher artwork in test fixtures

The Go gopher was designed by **Renee French**. The original design is licensed
under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
([legal code](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)).
See the [official Go gopher attribution](https://go.dev/doc/gopher/README)
and [The Go Gopher](https://go.dev/blog/gopher).

The following monochrome fixture versions were copied without further changes
from [hhrutter/tiff v1.0.6 testdata](https://github.com/hhrutter/tiff/tree/v1.0.6/testdata):

- `internal/pages/testdata/bw-gopher.png`
- `internal/pages/testdata/bw-gopher_ccittGroup3.tiff`
- `internal/pages/testdata/bw-gopher_ccittGroup4.tiff`

Retain this artwork attribution in addition to the upstream BSD notice.
These assets are used only for tests and are not embedded in the CLI binary.
No endorsement by the artist, the Go project, or dependency authors is implied.

The `synthetic-group{3,4}-photo{0,1}.tiff` files are project-generated geometric
test images, contain no gopher artwork, and are covered by the root MIT license.
Their generation with Pillow/libtiff does not add those tools to the CLI runtime.

## User-supplied assets

Stamp images and installed fonts are supplied by the user and are not relicensed
or bundled by imgstamp. Their respective licenses govern their use.

## GUI runtime modules

The following modules are in the native desktop GUI dependency graphs for
macOS ARM64 and Windows x64. The list is their union, inspected with
`go list -deps`; the exact upstream license files are reproduced below,
grouped only when their files are byte-identical. GUI dependency modules are
resolved from the pinned versions in `go.mod`.

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
